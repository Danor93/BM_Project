# BM_Project
As part of our degree, we have developed a client-server application called "BiteMe" which manages orders from private accounts or business accounts (linked to a specific company, requesting the service) for selected restaurants.
The application includes management and operation of branch managers, suppliers, human resources managers and CEOs of "BiteMe" in all parts of the country (north, center, south).
The management is reflected in the approval of suppliers, approval of private and business accounts, adding and removing dishes from the menus, building monthly reports and more.
The interface is developed ,using JavaFx and the logic using JAVA.
The connection between the server and the client was made through a framework called OCSF, which we learned during the semester.
In addition, we have added unit tests for each user login and upload of a PDF file, both on the server side and on the server side.
The project gave us a small glimpse into how teamwork should be done efficiently and correctly and how to divide the work among all team members so that several steps are done in parallel.
In addition, we experienced for the first time, a development of a server side and a client side similar to software or application development in the industry.
The overall score we received for the project is 95.
